# Film Query Project

# Description

This project is a command line application where the user is prompted to look up a film from an existing database by its identification number or by a keyword. Upon launch, the user is prompted to select from a list of menu options. After a selection is made, the application prompts the user appropriately based on their initial selection. When the application collects the input from the user, it searches the film database for matches based on the input. The application then prints the matches and their respective details (title, release year, rating, description, language, actors in the film) to the screen. The application exists within a loop, continuing to prompt the user to select from the menu until the Exit Application option is chosen. 


# Technologies Used
Eclipse, MySQL, Git, Terminal

# What I learned
This application was my introduction to integrating data from a database into a Java program. Prior to this exercise, I had experience with database queries and I had experience with Java programs, but had never married them together. I learned how to prompt and collect user inputs to execute and return a query. To be specific, I was introduced to the Connection, PreparedStatement, and ResultSet classes and methods for the first time. Another useful tool I first experienced building this application is the bind variable. By using that, it was easy to collect a user input and translate it into a SQL query.
